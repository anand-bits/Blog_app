## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Flutter SDK**: If you have not already, download and install Flutter by following the official installation guide for your platform: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

2. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: You'll need an integrated development environment (IDE) to write and run Flutter code. You can choose between Android Studio and Visual Studio Code. Install one of them and set up the Flutter extension.

3. **Device or Emulator**: You can run your Flutter app on a physical device or an emulator. Ensure that you have a device connected or an emulator set up. You can create and manage emulators using the Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager in Android Studio.
